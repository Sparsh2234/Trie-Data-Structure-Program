# Trie-Data-Structure-Program
Recursively implemented a Trie Data Structure to support various word manipulations including Autocomplete. A trie is a 26-ary tree where the root node represents an empty string “” and if the kth (k going from 0 to 25) subtree is not a null subtree, it represents a string that is the concatenation of the characters represented by the parent and the kth letter of the alphabet (where ‘a’ is the 0th letter).
